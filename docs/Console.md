## Logging in

There are two ways to log in: root user or IAM user

### Root user
Root is a super user. It is used to log into an account for the first time to make IAM users or for certain special actions. It should not be used for daily activities. 

### IAM user
IAM users are tied to an account. They have login privileges and API access via an `access key`. 

## Regions
AWS has many regions. Some services are global, but most are regional. The region selector is located on the top right next to support. 

## Cloud Shell
AWS provides a web based shell with a bunch of tools installed. It does not currently support VPC access. It is located to the right of the search bar

## Navigation
You can select a service by clicking the `service` button on the top left or searching for something.
